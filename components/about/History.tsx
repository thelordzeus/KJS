							The seeds for peace were sown in 2017, with the
							simple aim of spreading Climate change Awareness.
							However, no sooner did the start of the covid-19
							disillusion the humankind than the work evolved to
							help spread awareness about the disease. Inspired by
							the Karan Gupta Education foundation, our founder,
							Parul Khanna, made it the vision to help mankind and
							change the world. Since then, the seeds sown have
							created a full fledged tree with different leaves
							denoting its breadth to divergent areas of the
							society. In 2020, the health&apos;s leaves touched
							the rural community with branches further deepening
							to the anti-tobacco campaign in 2021; With its roots
							strengthening, the leaves further spread to
							education and establishment of rural libraries. The
							leaves, hence delivered the pencil&apos;s promise by
							2021. Climate change, was the name written on seeds
							sown, with its manifestation being in multiplication
							of plants planted and removal of plastics. 2022
							marked not only women empowerment but also fastened
							the roots to more social issues; expanding on these
							leaves, the tree continues to thrive hoping to
							further its reach and intensify its shade so as to
							protect the community by the vices present in
							society.
